* A Shiny app that allows a user to draw datasets on a graph then have the data points generated automatically, can slider Variance, disturbance points etc.
	* Got some way with the UI, but haven't found a decent librayr for bezier curve drawing. Maybe in javascript:

		* https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bezier/bezier.pdf
		* https://github.com/vrk/beziertool/
			* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/bezierCurveTo

	* Should I limit myself to 2 continuous distributions. Adding lots of conditionals for categorical variables is confusing and difficult
	* Generating the min and max from the mean is not a good way of doing things. Think of better method
	* Is there a way to make the standard deviation in x change with different values of y and vice versa - non-independent error
