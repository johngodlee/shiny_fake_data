* A Shiny app that allows a user to draw datasets on a graph then have the data points generated automatically, can slider Variance, disturbance points etc.
	* Got some way with the UI, but haven't found a decent librayr for bezier curve drawing. Maybe in javascript:

		* https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bezier/bezier.pdf
		* https://github.com/vrk/beziertool/
			* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/bezierCurveTo
		* https://www.aridhia.com/blog/the-sky-is-not-the-limit-embedding-raw-html-and-javascript-to-create-dynamic-ui-elements-in-shiny-applications/ 
	
* Is there a problem in the distribution switching when min bigger than max?
